The main idea of this project is to create a simple **web service for a barber shop** that allows clients to:

- view information about the barbershop (landing page);
- **book an appointment with a barber online**;
- automatically **synchronize bookings with the administrator‚Äôs Google Calendar**.

The project follows the same structure as the tutorial **Tutor.docx**, from domain models and use cases to deployment.

This allows frontend to directly send booking requests to the script, which:

- receives the booking data;
- creates an event in Google Calendar;
- returns confirmation to frontend.
